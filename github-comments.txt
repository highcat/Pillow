It's easy to miss but if you go to Travis CI and look in the right sidebar for \"Queue: PHP, Perl and Python\" and scroll down, you will see 3 \"collective/Pillow\" jobs (one for each Python version probably) and then a bunch of stuff and then 3 more \"collective/Pillow\" jobs (probably because you didn't see anything happen and then submitted it again? :-)) Been there, done that.\n\nMost of the time, jobs run very quickly after they're triggered, but I think sometimes the queue gets broken for a few hours (known issue in Travis; they need to improve their monitoring) and then a lot of jobs pile up. So sometimes you have to wait a while. The good news is that Travis should send you an email when the job finally executes.",
