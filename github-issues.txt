    "body": "The current Pillow repository is just a copy of the working directory of PIL from two years ago â€“ there is no history available. To be fair, Pillow was only meant to be a temporary packaging fork, but I think the history is quite important when the project should move forward. There are also a lot of \"recent\" changes in PIL that are missing in Pillow. Getting all these changes back manually is a lot of work. I propose to convert the official BitBucket repository to Git with hg-git and to merge the relatively few Pillow changes back.\nThat way we would have a repository with history, all current changes (including first work on Python 3 support) plus the Pillow packaging changes. Of course, the downside of this is that all forks become invalid (2 with actual changes).\n\nI'm stepping forward to do this and I will start with it in my own repository. If it works well I'll come back to this issue.",
